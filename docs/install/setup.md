![initialsetup](img/initialsetup.png)

After first installation ESPGeiger requires configuring for connection to a WiFi network.

The ESPGeiger opens a local WiFi hotspot which allows the user to configure which WiFi network the ESPGeiger connects to.

Connecting to this WiFi hotspot should automatically show a configuration page. Visiting http://192.168.4.1/ whilst connected to the hotspot will also show the configuration page.
