# Quick Install Guide

Below is the quick overview of installing, for more detailed information, please visit the sub pages.

## Requirements

- ESP8266 or ESP32 development board
  - Wemos D1 Mini is recommended
- A pulse or compatible serial based Geiger Counter
- Dupont/jumper wires

Optional:

- OLED screen
- ESPGeiger Log kit

_OR_

- ESPGeigerHW Geiger Counter kit

## Web Install

The easiest way to install is to visit the web based installed in your Chrome or Edge browser:

1. Visit <https://install.espgeiger.com> and follow the instructions to install the latest firmware.
  - Select your Geiger Counter type from the dropdown list - in most cases this is "Pulse"
  - Once installed your ESP device will create its own Wi-Fi network with the name in the format of "**ESPGeiger-XXXXXX**"
  - The status LED of the ESP will be lit
2. On your phone or computer, connect to to the new Wi-Fi network
  - Make a note of the name of the ESPGeiger (**ESPGeiger-XXXXXX**) - we will need this soon.
3. Configure ESPGeiger to connect to your home Wi-Fi network
  - Once connected the status LED of the ESP will go out
4. Browse to http://**ESPGeiger-XXXXXX**.local
  - Once connected to your home network you can now connect to it using the IP address assigned by your router or http://ESPGeiger-XXXXXX.local

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ ESPGeiger is installed

## Hardware connection

Note: By default the RXPIN for ESPGeiger is set to `GPIO13` - this can be changed from the Web Portal.

- Connect the *Pulse Output* of the Geiger Counter to `GPIO13`
- Connect the `GND` of the Geiger Counter to `GND`

# Build Targets

Builds for both ESP8266 and ESP32 are built automatically by github on release.

Builds for a number of target counters are available.

## Pulse

The pulse Geiger counter target is the widest compatible target. This is used for all Pulse type Geiger counters. A list of compatible and tested Pulse counters cant be found under the hardware section.

| Target Name | Target Counter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
`pulse` | Pulse | ESP32 builds default to using built in hardware PCNT counter
`pulse_no_pcnt` | Pulse | ESP32-only build disabling PCNT

## Serial

Numerous serial Geiger target builds are made, one for each of the following target serial counters -

| Target Name | Target Counter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
`gc10` | GC10 | 
`gc10next` | GC10-next | 
`mightyohm` | Mighty Ohm |

## Hardware

| Target Name | Target Counter | Counter Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
`espgeigerhw` | ESPGeiger-HW | Pulse | Build for the ESPGeiger-HW Geiger Counter. Controls PWM for HV along with other specifics for hardware.
`espgeigerlog` | ESPGeiger-Log | Pulse | A pulse based build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware with NeoPixel and SDCard output.
`espgeigerlog_gc10` | ESPGeiger-Log | GC10 | A GC10 serial based build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware with NeoPixel and SDCard output.
`espgeigerlog_gc10next` | ESPGeiger-Log | GC10next | A GC10next serial based build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware with NeoPixel and SDCard output.
`espgeigerlog_mightyohm` | ESPGeiger-Log | Mighty Ohm | A Mighty Ohm serial based build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware with NeoPixel and SDCard output.

## Test

Test builds can be used to emulate a Geiger counter with your board. You can connect the ESPGeiger RXPIN and TXPIN together, or connect one ESPGeiger TXPIN to the RXPIN on another.
 
| Target Name | Target Counter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
`test` | n/a | Internal interrupt based counter. No output, mostly for testing the Counter.h functionality.
`testpulse` | Pulse | Test build which outputs a pulse on the TXPIN
`testgc10` | GC10 | Test build which outputs an emulated GC10 serial based Geiger counter on the TXPIN
`testmightyohm` | Mighty Ohm | Test build which outputs an emulated Mighty Ohm serial based Geiger counter on the TXPIN

## Hardware Test

| Target Name | Target Counter | Counter Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
`espgeigerlog_test` | ESPGeiger-Log | n/a | A test build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware. Internal interrupt based counter. No output, mostly for testing the ESPGeiger-Log functionality.
`espgeigerlog_testpulse` | ESPGeiger-Log | Pulse | A test build for the ESPGeiger-Log hardware. Test build which outputs a pulse on the PLS pin.
